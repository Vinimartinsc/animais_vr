### About
_Originally written in Brazilian portuguese and published on December 23, 2018_

Students from the Information Systems course, Vinicius Martins and Patrick Spilari, former PET-SI members, developed a smartphone application that promotes learning in Veterinary Science through immersive technology using Virtual Reality, or VR.

The project emerged from a proposal by Professor Sergio Serra to the students in the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) course. With the proposal sparking interest due to its unique approach and the opportunity to expand knowledge shared in the classroom, the students decided to develop the project to learn more about this new paradigm of virtual reality.

The application's primary goal is to teach children and young learners about curiosities of the animal world and to test the userâ€™s attention and perception while using the app.

The development utilized the Unity 3D platform, widely recognized in the gaming industry for game development, as the base for the application, the Android operating system, and VR headsets like Google Cardboard and other compatible devices. Android and Google Cardboard were chosen for their widespread availability, affordability, and low cost.

So far, this is the first and only project developed by Information Systems students at UFRRJ, based on creating an application that utilizes Virtual Reality with smartphones.

The project was presented to Professor Luciano Alonso from the Institute of Biological and Health Sciences (ICBS), establishing an academic partnership for the advancement and development of new apps focused on the field of Anatomy.
